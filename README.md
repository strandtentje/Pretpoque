# Pretpoque

Use this tool for controlling and/or simulating keyboard and mouse input using your game controller.

This has been designed for playing minecraft, but it isn't restricted to that. The included button mapping is largely minecraft-oriented though. Use PretpoqueGui to modify the settings file, or do it by hand. It's not too hard.

This should work with any game controller that OpenTK picks up on, such as Logitech Extreme 3D's, Xbox Controllers, generic gamepads, et cetera.
